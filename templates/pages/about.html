                        Hello, I'm Brandon, the passionate waterman behind ADV eFoils.
                        Founded in 2025, this business emerged from my lifelong passion for the water and sharing the exhilarating experience of
                        foiling with everyone, regardless of wave conditions. I envisioned a world
                        where the freedom of flight over water wasn't limited by tides or wind, but powered
                        by sustainable, cutting-edge technology.  ADV eFoils stands as a testament to my dedication and passion, offering premium
                        eFoil experiences and lessons that redefine water adventure. I'm not just teaching eFoiling;
                        I'm sharing a lifestyle of unparalleled freedom and connection with the ocean, one glide at a time.
