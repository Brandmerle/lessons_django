                            Hello, I'm Kelly, the passionate waterman behind Isla eFoiling.
                            Founded in 2025, this business emerged from my lifelong passion for the water and sharing the exhilarating experience of
                            foiling with everyone, regardless of wave conditions. I envisioned a world
                            where the freedom of flight over water wasn't limited by tides or wind, but powered
                            by sustainable, cutting-edge technology. Isla eFoiling stands as a testament to my dedication and passion, offering premium
                            eFoil experiences and lessons that redefine water adventure. I'm not just teaching eFoiling;
                            I'm sharing a lifestyle of unparalleled freedom and connection with the ocean, one glide at a time.
