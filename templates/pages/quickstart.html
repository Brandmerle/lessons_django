                    <h4>Safety Briefing & Equipment Familiarization</h4>
                    <p>Before launching into the blue, your instructor will guide you through all safety protocols and how to master your efoil's controls.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Prone Riding (Lying Down)</h4>
                    <p>Begin by lying on your stomach, getting a feel for the board's balance and the remote's speed control. It's your first taste of the glide!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Kneeling to Standing Transition</h4>
                    <p>Once you're comfortable prone, practice kneeling, then gradually push up to a standing position. Keep those knees soft and weight centered for smooth transitions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Controlling the Foil (Lift-off)</h4>
                    <p>As you build speed, a gentle shift of weight back will lift you above the water. Small, precise movements are your secret to sustained, magical flight.</p>
