                            Efoiling is the exhilarating sport of riding an electric hydrofoil board over water.
                            Imagine effortlessly gliding above the shimmering surface of a tropical lagoon!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's powered by a silent electric motor and a hydrofoil wing that lifts you, creating
                            the unique sensation of flying. Controlled by a handheld remote, it's an eco-friendly
                            adventure perfect for serene tropical waters, no waves required.
                        </p>

                    Follow these foundational steps to get comfortable and start flying effortlessly across the tropical waters:
                </p>
                <ol class="numbered-list">
                    <li>
                        <h4>Safety Briefing & Equipment Familiarization</h4>
                        <p>Before launching into the blue, your instructor will guide you through all safety protocols and how to master your efoil's controls.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Prone Riding (Lying Down)</h4>
                        <p>Begin by lying on your stomach, getting a feel for the board's balance and the remote's speed control. It's your first taste of the glide!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Kneeling to Standing Transition</h4>
                        <p>Once you're comfortable prone, practice kneeling, then gradually push up to a standing position. Keep those knees soft and weight centered for smooth transitions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Controlling the Foil (Lift-off)</h4>
                        <p>As you build speed, a gentle shift of weight back will lift you above the water. Small, precise movements are your secret to sustained, magical flight.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Gentle Turns & Speed Management</h4>
                        <p>Mastering turns comes with subtle weight shifts. Learn to smoothly adjust your speed, carving through the water with grace.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Sustained Flight & Practice</h4>
                        <p>The more you practice, the more natural efoiling becomes. Enjoy the unparalleled sensation of flying, surrounded by the beauty of paradise.</p>
